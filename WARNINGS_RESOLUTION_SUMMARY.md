# Workspace Warnings Resolution Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Variable Reference Errors (6 warnings fixed)
**Location:** `app.py` line 2566
**Problem:** Undefined variables in SQL INSERT statement
```python
# ❌ Before (causing 6 errors)
''', (title, source, level, url, points, description, datetime.now().isoformat()))

# ✅ After (fixed)
''', (course['title'], course['source'], course['level'], course['url'], course['points'], course['description'], datetime.now().isoformat()))
```

**Root Cause:** 
- The code was iterating through `sample_courses` list
- Each `course` was a dictionary with keys like `title`, `source`, etc.
- The INSERT statement was trying to use undefined variables instead of accessing dictionary values

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed all variable references to use proper dictionary access: `course['key']`
- This resolved all 6 undefined variable errors for: title, source, level, url, points, description

### 2. Previous BuildError Fix Maintained
**Route:** `complete_course` endpoint
**Status:** ✅ Still working correctly from previous fix
