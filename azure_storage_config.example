# Azure Storage Configuration for Database Persistence
# 
# To enable Azure Storage database sync, you need to set these environment variables
# in your Azure App Service Configuration:
#
# 1. Go to Azure Portal → Your App Service → Configuration → Application Settings
# 2. Add these settings:

# REQUIRED: Azure Storage Connection String
# Get this from: Azure Portal → Storage Account → Access Keys → Connection String
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT;AccountKey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net

# OPTIONAL: Container name for database backups (default: database-backup)
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=database-backup

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT: For testing locally, you can create a .env file with:
# AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=UseDevelopmentStorage=true  # For Azure Storage Emulator
# Or use your actual Azure Storage connection string

# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit actual connection strings to version control
# - Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
# - Rotate storage keys regularly
# - Consider using Managed Identity for authentication
