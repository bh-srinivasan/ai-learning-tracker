# Upload Reports Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Upload Reports feature provides persistent, queryable, and purgeable reporting for Excel course uploads with detailed audit trails and admin-only access. This feature is built on top of the robust upload logic and provides comprehensive tracking and management capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Persistent Upload Reporting
- **Database Schema**: Added `excel_upload_reports` and `excel_upload_row_details` tables
- **Cross-Environment Support**: Works with both SQLite (local) and Azure SQL (production)
- **Automatic Report Creation**: Every upload automatically creates a persistent report entry

### 2. Detailed Audit Trails
- **Row-by-Row Tracking**: Each row processed during upload is tracked with status and message
- **Status Categories**: SUCCESS, ERROR, SKIPPED with detailed messages
- **Course Information**: Tracks course title and URL for successful uploads
- **Validation Warnings**: Captures data quality warnings

### 3. Admin Interface
- **Reports List**: Comprehensive list of all upload reports with filtering options
- **Detailed Drilldown**: Click any report to see row-by-row processing details
- **Status Filtering**: View all rows, or filter by SUCCESS, ERROR, or SKIPPED status
- **Export Functionality**: Export detailed reports as CSV files

### 4. Statistics Dashboard
- **Upload Statistics**: Total uploads, success/error counts, unique users
- **Time-Based Filtering**: View reports from last 7, 30, 90, 180, or 365 days
- **Real-Time Updates**: Statistics refresh automatically

### 5. Automated Purging
- **Manual Purging**: Admin interface for purging old reports
- **Scheduled Purging**: Command-line script for automated cleanup
- **Safety Controls**: Minimum 7-day retention period
- **Purge Recommendations**: Analytics to suggest optimal purging schedules

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Upload Reports Table
excel_upload_reports (
    id, user_id, filename, upload_timestamp,
    total_rows, processed_rows, success_count, 
    error_count, warnings_count
)

-- Row Details Table  
excel_upload_row_details (
    id, report_id, row_number, status, message,
    course_title, course_url
)
```

### Files Structure
```
/upload_reports_manager.py          # Backend CRUD operations
/admin_reports_routes.py            # Flask routes for admin interface
/scheduled_purge_reports.py         # Automated purging script
/templates/admin/
  ├── upload_reports.html           # Main reports list
  ├── upload_report_details.html    # Detailed drilldown view
  └── upload_report_table.html      # Reusable table component
/enhanced_excel_upload.py           # Updated with reporting integration
/database_environment_manager.py   # Updated schema with new tables
```

### Integration Points
- **Enhanced Upload Logic**: Automatically creates reports during upload
- **Admin Panel**: Added "Upload Reports" button in courses management
- **Flask App**: Registered new blueprint for reports routes
- **Database Manager**: Extended schema to include reporting tables

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Upload Reports
1. **Admin Panel**: Go to Admin → Manage Courses
2. **Click "Upload Reports"**: Access comprehensive reports interface
3. **Filter by Time**: Select time range (7 days to 1 year)
4. **View Details**: Click any report for row-by-row analysis
5. **Export Data**: Download CSV exports for external analysis

### Understanding Report Status
- **SUCCESS**: Row processed successfully, course added/updated
- **ERROR**: Row failed processing due to validation or database errors
- **SKIPPED**: Row skipped (usually duplicates or invalid data)

### Managing Storage
1. **Manual Purging**: Use admin interface to purge old reports
2. **Automated Purging**: Set up scheduled task with `scheduled_purge_reports.py`
3. **Recommendations**: Get data-driven purging suggestions

### Scheduled Purging Setup
```bash
# Show purging recommendations
python scheduled_purge_reports.py --recommendations

# Dry run to see what would be purged
python scheduled_purge_reports.py --days 90 --dry-run

# Actual purge (keep last 90 days)
python scheduled_purge_reports.py --days 90

# Set up as scheduled task (example for daily run)
# Windows: Use Task Scheduler
# Linux/Mac: Add to crontab
# 0 2 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/scheduled_purge_reports.py --days 90
```

## Security Features

### Admin-Only Access
- **Authentication Required**: Only admin users can access reports
- **Route Protection**: All report routes require admin privileges
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unauthorized access

### Data Privacy
- **User Information**: Only username displayed, no sensitive data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking for compliance and debugging
- **Secure Export**: CSV exports include only necessary data

## Environment Compatibility

### Local Development (SQLite)
- Full feature compatibility
- Fast performance for moderate data volumes
- Ideal for development and testing

### Production (Azure SQL)
- Optimized for high-volume data
- Proper indexing for performance
- Enterprise-grade reliability

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexed Columns**: Key columns indexed for fast queries
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized SQL for large datasets
- **Pagination Ready**: Framework for future pagination implementation

### Memory Management
- **Chunked Processing**: Large reports handled efficiently
- **Export Limits**: CSV exports designed for reasonable file sizes
- **Query Optimization**: Time-based filtering to limit data scope

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Log Files
- **Application Logs**: Detailed logging for all operations
- **Purge Logs**: Separate log file for purging operations
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and handling

### Health Checks
- **Database Connectivity**: Automatic connection management
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures tables exist and are properly structured
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Tables**: Run database setup to create reporting tables
2. **Permission Errors**: Ensure admin user has proper privileges
3. **Large Datasets**: Use filtering and export for better performance
4. **Integration Issues**: Check blueprint registration in app.py

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database schema
python -c "from database_environment_manager import DatabaseEnvironmentManager; dm = DatabaseEnvironmentManager(); dm.ensure_schema()"

# Test reporting functionality
python -c "from upload_reports_manager import get_upload_reports; print(get_upload_reports())"

# Check purging recommendations
python scheduled_purge_reports.py --recommendations
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alert admins of upload issues
- **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and performance metrics
- **User-Specific Reports**: Allow users to view their own upload history
- **API Endpoints**: REST API for programmatic access

### Performance Improvements
- **Pagination**: For very large datasets
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed reports
- **Async Processing**: Background processing for large uploads
- **Database Partitioning**: Table partitioning for high-volume environments
