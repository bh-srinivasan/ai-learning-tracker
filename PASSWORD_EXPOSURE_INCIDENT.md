# Security Incident Report - Password Exposure

## Summary
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

## Issue Description
During debugging of Azure SQL connection issues, database passwords were accidentally committed to the Git repository in both source code and commit messages.

## Affected Components
- **Repository**: ai-learning-tracker
- **Files**: app.py, test routes
- **Commit Messages**: Multiple commits contained exposed passwords

## Exposed Information
- Azure SQL Server password was exposed in:
  - Git commit messages (commit `6eccbea`)
  - Source code hardcoded values
  - Test route implementations

## Timeline
1. **Password Exposure**: During Azure SQL debugging, password was hardcoded in source
2. **Commit Exposure**: Password included in git commit message
3. **Detection**: User identified the security issue
4. **Remediation**: All hardcoded passwords removed from source code

## Remediation Actions Taken
1. ✅ **Removed all hardcoded passwords** from app.py
2. ✅ **Replaced with environment variable references**
3. ✅ **Updated test routes** to use environment variables only
4. ✅ **Created security fix commit** with proper documentation

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

### For Developers
- **NEVER hardcode passwords** in source code
- **NEVER include passwords** in commit messages
- **Always use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Review commits** before pushing to ensure no sensitive data

### For Azure Deployment
- Set `AZURE_SQL_PASSWORD` environment variable in Azure App Service
- Use Azure Key Vault for production password management
- Rotate passwords regularly
- Enable Azure SQL audit logging

## Required Manual Actions
Since Git history cannot be completely cleaned without affecting the repository, the following manual actions are required:

1. **Rotate the Azure SQL password** that was exposed
2. **Update Azure App Service environment variables** with new password
3. **Monitor for any unauthorized access** to the Azure SQL database
4. **Consider repository access** - review who has access to this repository

## Prevention Measures
1. Add `.env` files to `.gitignore` to prevent environment file commits
2. Use git hooks to scan for passwords before commits
3. Implement code review process for all changes
4. Use Azure Key Vault for production deployments

## Lessons Learned
- Debug routes should NEVER contain real passwords
- Environment variables should be used for ALL sensitive data
- Git commit messages should be reviewed for sensitive information
- Security should be considered in all debugging processes

## Status
**RESOLVED** - All hardcoded passwords removed from source code.  
**PENDING** - Manual password rotation and Azure environment update required.
