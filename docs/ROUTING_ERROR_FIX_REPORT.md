# Flask Routing Error Fix Report

## Issue Description
The user was encountering a Flask routing error when accessing the "My Courses" page:

```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'admin.url_validation'. Did you mean 'admin_validate_password' instead?
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **duplicate route definitions** in the `admin/routes.py` file. Specifically:

1. There were two `@admin_bp.route('/admin/url-validation')` decorators
2. There were two `def url_validation():` functions  
3. The duplicate definitions were conflicting during Flask's route registration process

## Solution Applied

### 1. Identified the Duplication
- Found duplicate routes starting at line 1041 in `admin/routes.py`
- The original routes were correctly defined starting around line 879
- The duplicates appeared to be accidentally added during development

### 2. Removed Duplicate Routes
- Truncated the file at line 1040 to remove all duplicate route definitions
- This removed approximately 300+ lines of duplicated code
- Preserved the original, working route definitions

### 3. Verified the Fix
- Created test scripts to verify route registration
- Confirmed that `admin.url_validation` endpoint is now properly registered
- Successfully tested template rendering without errors
- Started Flask application and confirmed it runs without routing errors

## Routes Now Working Correctly

The following URL validation routes are now properly registered:

- `admin.url_validation` → `/admin/url-validation` (GET)
- `admin.url_validation_status` → `/admin/url-validation-status` (GET) 
- `admin.validate_urls` → `/admin/validate-urls` (POST)
- `admin.validate_single_url` → `/admin/validate-url/<int:course_id>` (POST)

## Testing Results

✅ **Route Registration**: All 24 admin routes properly registered  
✅ **URL Building**: `admin.url_validation` endpoint builds correctly  
✅ **Template Rendering**: Both `admin/courses.html` and `admin/url_validation.html` render successfully  
✅ **Flask Application**: Starts and runs without errors  

## Next Steps

The user can now:
1. Access the "My Courses" page without routing errors
2. Use the admin URL validation features 
3. Navigate between admin pages normally

The Flask application is ready for continued development and testing.
