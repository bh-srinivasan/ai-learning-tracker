# URL Status Filter - Final Debug and Fix

The current issue persists. Let me analyze the problem systematically:

## Problem Analysis

1. **URL Status filter shows no results** for Working, Not Working, and Broken
2. **Only Unchecked filter works**
3. **Debug logging added** to understand what's happening

## Possible Issues

1. **Text extraction not working correctly**
2. **Event listener not firing**
3. **JavaScript error preventing execution**
4. **Case sensitivity mismatch**

## Step-by-Step Fix

Let me implement a bulletproof solution:

1. **Simplify the text extraction** to be more robust
2. **Add comprehensive error handling**
3. **Use more reliable matching logic**
4. **Ensure event listeners are properly attached**

## Implementation

The current logic tries to extract text and clean it, but maybe the regex isn't working as expected in all browsers. Let me create a simpler, more reliable approach.
