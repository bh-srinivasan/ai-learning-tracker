USER DELETION ISSUE - RESOLUTION SUMMARY
=========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Users were being deleted after every server refresh/deployment
- New users (like "Sachin") would disappear after Azure deployments
- Database was resetting to a previous state

ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED:
The database file (ai_learning.db) was being tracked by Git and committed to version control.
Every time the application was deployed to Azure, the production database was overwritten
with the development database from the Git repository, causing all recent user data to be lost.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. ‚úÖ Added ai_learning.db to .gitignore to prevent future commits
2. ‚úÖ Removed ai_learning.db from Git tracking using `git rm --cached`
3. ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to exclude all database files (*.db, *.sqlite, *.sqlite3)
4. ‚úÖ Committed and deployed the fix to both GitHub and Azure
5. ‚úÖ Verified that test user "Sachin" persists after deployment

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
- Database file is no longer tracked by Git ‚úÖ
- Test user "Sachin" (ID: 6) exists after deployment ‚úÖ
- Azure application is running successfully (HTTP 200) ‚úÖ
- Local database maintains user data integrity ‚úÖ

IMPACT:
- FIXED: Users will no longer be deleted during deployments
- FIXED: New users will persist across server restarts
- FIXED: Production database will not be overwritten by development data
- SECURE: Database is now properly excluded from version control

PREVENTION:
The .gitignore file now includes:
- *.db
- *.sqlite
- *.sqlite3
- ai_learning.db

This ensures that database files will never be accidentally committed again.

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
‚úÖ Local: Fixed and verified
‚úÖ GitHub: Updated with fix (commit 164d810)
‚úÖ Azure: Deployed successfully and running

NEXT STEPS:
1. Monitor the application to ensure users persist after future deployments
2. Consider implementing database backup strategies for production
3. Test user creation/deletion functionality to ensure it works correctly
4. Document this incident to prevent similar issues in the future

LESSON LEARNED:
Never commit database files to version control in production applications.
Database files should always be excluded from Git tracking to prevent
data loss during deployments.
