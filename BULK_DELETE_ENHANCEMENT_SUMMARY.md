@app.route('/admin/bulk-delete-courses', methods=['POST'])
@require_admin
def admin_bulk_delete_courses():
    # Multi-course deletion with transaction safety
    # Input validation, error handling, user feedback
```

</button>
```

5. **Execute**: Clicks "Delete Courses" to confirm
6. **Feedback**: Success message shows "Successfully deleted X course(s)!"

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimizations

- **Debounced Updates**: Button state updates efficiently batched
- **Memory Management**: Modal cleaned up after use
- **Database**: Single transaction for all deletions

### Scalability
- **Large Datasets**: Handles hundreds of courses efficiently
- **Preview Limit**: Shows only first 10 courses in confirmation to prevent UI bloat
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

### Input Validation
- Course IDs validated as integers
- SQL injection prevention
- Admin-only route protection

### User Safety
- **Double Confirmation**: Button click + modal confirmation
- **Clear Preview**: Shows exactly what will be deleted
- **Transaction Safety**: All-or-nothing deletion approach
- **Detailed Feedback**: Clear success/error messages

### Data Integrity
- **Related Records**: Removes user_courses associations
- **Rollback Support**: Failed operations don't leave partial state
- **Audit Trail**: Deletion counts logged for tracking

## üì± Responsive Design

### Mobile Adaptations
- **Button Layout**: Stack buttons vertically on small screens
- **Modal Size**: Responsive modal sizing
- **Touch Friendly**: Larger tap targets for checkboxes
- **Horizontal Scroll**: Table maintains usability on narrow screens

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
- **Screen Readers**: Full ARIA label support
