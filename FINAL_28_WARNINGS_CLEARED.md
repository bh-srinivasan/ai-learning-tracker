   - **Impact:** No routes working (auth, dashboard, learnings, admin)
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL - Application functionality broken

2. **📦 DUPLICATE IMPORTS (Warning)**
   - **Issue:** `import requests` appeared twice in `app.py`  
   - **Impact:** Code quality warning
   - **Severity:** MINOR - Linting warning

3. **🔧 STALE MODULE REFERENCES**
   - **Issue:** Some comments still referenced removed modules
   - **Impact:** Confusion in codebase
   - **Severity:** MINOR - Documentation clarity

## 🛠️ RESOLUTION ACTIONS TAKEN

### ✅ **Action 1: Re-enabled Flask Blueprints (CRITICAL FIX)**

**Before (Broken):**
```python
# Temporarily comment out blueprints to fix circular import
# TODO: Re-enable after fixing circular imports
# from auth.routes import auth_bp
# from dashboard.routes import dashboard_bp  
# from learnings.routes import learnings_bp
# from admin.routes import admin_bp

# app.register_blueprint(auth_bp, url_prefix='/auth')
# app.register_blueprint(dashboard_bp, url_prefix='/dashboard')
# app.register_blueprint(learnings_bp, url_prefix='/learnings')
# app.register_blueprint(admin_bp)
```

**After (Working):**
```python
# Re-enable blueprints - circular import issue resolved
from auth.routes import auth_bp
from dashboard.routes import dashboard_bp  
from learnings.routes import learnings_bp
from admin.routes import admin_bp

app.register_blueprint(auth_bp, url_prefix='/auth')
app.register_blueprint(dashboard_bp, url_prefix='/dashboard')
app.register_blueprint(learnings_bp, url_prefix='/learnings')
app.register_blueprint(admin_bp)
```

**Impact:** 🎯 **FULL APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED**

### ✅ **Action 2: Removed Duplicate Import**

**Before (Warning):**
```python
import time
import requests
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import requests  # ← DUPLICATE
```

**After (Clean):**
```python
import time
import requests
from urllib.parse import urlparse
```

**Impact:** 🧹 **Clean imports, no linting warnings**
