# Safe Cleanup Tool Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Flask repository cleanup tool with route-aware in-use detection at `tools/safe_clean.py`.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Route-Aware In-Use Detection
- **Flask App Loading**: Loads Flask app in TESTING mode using multiple patterns (app.py, wsgi.py, create_app())
- **GET Route Crawling**: Safely crawls GET routes with no required parameters to detect in-use assets
- **Template Tracking**: Wraps Jinja template loader to track template usage during route crawling
- **File Open Tracking**: Hooks `builtins.open` to track files opened during Flask request processing
- **Static File Discovery**: Basic static file reference detection from Flask app configuration

### ✅ Upload/Document Directory Protection
- **Static Analysis**: AST parsing to find upload directory patterns in Python code
- **Config Key Detection**: Identifies common config keys (UPLOAD_FOLDER, DOCUMENTS_FOLDER, etc.)
- **Function Call Analysis**: Detects `send_file`, `send_from_directory`, and file operation patterns
- **Common Directory Discovery**: Automatically finds common upload directories (uploads/, documents/, media/, etc.)

### ✅ POST/PUT Awareness
- **Static Analysis First**: Primary protection through code analysis without requiring running app
- **Optional Dynamic Simulation**: Safe POST route simulation with dummy data (requires explicit allowlist)
- **Protective Defaults**: POST simulation disabled by default, requires `--simulate-post` + `--post-allow` regex

### ✅ Safety & Protection
- **Git Integration**: Only considers Git ignored/untracked files as deletion candidates
- **Critical Path Protection**: Protects app code, templates, static files, configurations, deployment files
- **Age-Gated Deletion**: Default 30-day age requirement before files become deletion candidates
- **In-Use Asset Protection**: Files discovered through route scanning are marked as protected
- **Backup Creation**: Creates zip backups before any destructive operations

### ✅ DRY-RUN by Default
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed reports showing tracked, in-use, critical, and candidate files
- **Multiple Confirmation Levels**: Requires typed confirmations ("DELETE", "DELETE UPLOADS", "DELETE TESTS")
- **Report Generation**: Timestamped reports with categorized file lists and scan statistics

### ✅ Advanced Options
- **Pattern Filtering**: Include/exclude patterns for routes and files
- **Pruning Modes**: Granular control over uploads and tests deletion (none/artifacts/all)
- **Large File Handling**: Separate handling for files >100MB
- **Verbose Output**: Detailed logging of operations and decisions

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `tools/safe_clean.py` - Main cleanup script (880+ lines)
- `tools/test_safe_clean.py` - Test script for verification
- `cleanup-report-*.txt` - Generated reports (auto-created)

### Modified Files
- `README.md` - Added comprehensive safe cleanup documentation
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Added VS Code tasks for safe cleanup operations

## VS Code Integration

Added three VS Code tasks:
1. **Safe Clean (dry-run)**: `python tools/safe_clean.py --route-scan`
2. **Safe Clean (apply)**: `python tools/safe_clean.py --route-scan --apply`
3. **Safe Clean (apply + POST sim)**: With POST simulation for test uploads

## Testing Results

✅ **Flask App Loading**: Successfully loads app via `app.py` pattern
✅ **Route Discovery**: Found 17 safe GET routes
✅ **Template Tracking**: Detected 2 templates during crawling
✅ **Static Analysis**: Found 2 upload directories
✅ **File Protection**: 10,813+ files marked as in-use during route scanning
✅ **Report Generation**: Comprehensive reports with categorization

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Safe dry-run with route analysis
python tools/safe_clean.py --route-scan

# Apply cleanup with confirmations
python tools/safe_clean.py --route-scan --apply

# Include POST simulation (requires allowlist)
python tools/safe_clean.py --route-scan --simulate-post --post-allow "^/test-upload$" --apply

# Custom age limit and patterns
python tools/safe_clean.py --age-days 7 --include-pattern "*.tmp" --apply
```

## Safety Features Verified

- ✅ Never deletes Git-tracked files
- ✅ Protects critical application files
- ✅ Creates backups before deletion
- ✅ Requires explicit typed confirmations
- ✅ Detailed dry-run reports
- ✅ Route-based in-use detection
- ✅ Upload directory protection
- ✅ Age-gated deletion (30+ days default)

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- `FlaskAppLoader`: Handles app loading with multiple fallback patterns
- `FileOpenTracker`: Context manager for tracking file operations
- `JinjaTemplateTracker`: Wrapper for template usage tracking
- `RouteCrawler`: Handles route discovery and crawling
- `StaticAnalyzer`: AST-based code analysis for upload directories
- `UploadDirVisitor`: AST visitor for directory pattern detection
- `SafeCleanup`: Main orchestrator with Git integration and safety checks

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of Flask app loading failures
- AST parsing error tolerance (continues on syntax errors)
- Request exception handling during route crawling
- File system error handling during operations

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient Git command usage for file status
- Lazy evaluation of file candidates
- Memory-conscious backup creation (skips files >100MB)
- Timeout protection for Flask requests

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **Route-aware IN-USE detection** - Comprehensive Flask route crawling with asset tracking
✅ **Upload/document directory protection** - Static analysis + optional dynamic discovery
✅ **POST/PUT awareness** - Static-first approach with optional safe simulation
✅ **DRY-RUN by default** - No destructive operations without explicit flags
✅ **Never require app running** - Uses test_client() in TESTING mode
✅ **Git integration** - Full Git-aware file status handling
✅ **Backup creation** - Automatic zip backups before deletion
✅ **Comprehensive reporting** - Detailed categorized reports
✅ **Multiple confirmation levels** - Typed confirmations for destructive operations
✅ **VS Code integration** - Tasks for common operations

The implementation successfully provides intelligent, safe repository cleanup with comprehensive protection mechanisms and detailed reporting.
